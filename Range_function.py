#   We use it to generate a sequence of numbers
#numbers = range(6) # numbers = range(6, 10) specified range

#print(numbers)

#   We can use Iteration i.e for loop to print all the numbers in the range
#for number in numbers:
    #print(number)

numbers = range(5, 10, 2) #  This will skip after every 2 numbers
for number in numbers:
    print(number)

for number in range(5): # Short cut on how not to store a number
    print(number)
